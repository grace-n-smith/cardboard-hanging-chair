# cardboard-hanging-chair

There are three main challenges to this project, so I will address them each individually: the glue, the body, and the support.
##The Body
The body will be made up of about 100 layers of stacked cardboard using the same technique to create [this chair](https://cdn.incollect.com/sites/default/files/zoom/Vintage-Corrugated-Cardboard-Chair-164900-211962.jpg), but the overall shape will be more akin to [this one](https://cdn.homecrux.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MC205_2.jpg) for increased user comfort as well as practicality for hanging the chair securely. These cardboard pieces can be cut out with a boxcutter, and symmetry can be ensured by making an exact duplicate of each new piece that is created, so even if the curvature varies slightly from the original design, the 

##The Glue
In order for the chair to be biodegradable, the glue that holds all of its surfaces together needs to be biodegradable as well. Fortunately, PVA glue is, and better still, it's readily available, inexpensive, and easy to work with. It bonds well with paper products (such as cardboard) and it has a long enough work time to be applied to the entire surface of a cardboard sheet, and a short enough one to set before too many new layers are added. This means that we do not risk accidentally shifting an entire stack of cardboard and skewing the final form. 

##The Support
How can we suspend a cardboard structure, though? Won't it just rip the cardboard? Well there are two ways to solve that problem. One is to spread the load evenly enough that is is supported all 100 sheets of cardboard at the top. However, another solution relies on the structural properties of cardboard. Importantly, cardboard is strong under compressive forces, so if the chains that suspend it go _under_ the chair to support it from below, then the cardboard is plenty strong enough to take the force. This method also makes the chair more stable, so it is the one we intend to use.
